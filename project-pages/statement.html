          <div class="body-text">Hey Everybody, my name is Austin Clinefelter and I am from the small town of Stokes in Eastern North Carolina.  I am a Management Information Systems major and I plan to graduate fall of 2024.  After I graduate I plan to continue on to get my Masterâ€™s of Business Administration from East Carolina University and possibly a certificate in Data Analytics.  I love teaching and working with people.  I would like to someday work at corporation where I can teach people how to use software or hardware applications.  Currently I work in Pirate Tech on the campus of East Carolina University.  This has been a great job for me as I have learned so much about Information Systems and have been able to apply that to my career goals by teaching students, faculty and staff.  My job has really increased my networking skills.  I am constantly interacting with faculty and outside representatives from companies such as Dell, Apple, Linux, and Cisco. </div>
          <div class="body-text">I live on a small farm with horses, pigs, goats, chickens and ducks. I just had 4 kids.  That would be baby goats.  They have kept me just as busy as my school work.</div>
